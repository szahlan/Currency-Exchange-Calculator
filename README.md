## Description 
This application converts US dollars into 5 different currencies, using a currency exchange API.

## Setup & installation
1. To obtain an API key, navigate to the [Exchange Rate API Page](https://www.exchangerate-api.com), click on "Plans" in the navbar, select the "Free" plan, enter your email and create a password and your API key will be automatically generated. 

2. Clone the repository to your computer.

3. Navigate to the directory of the project.

4. Create a new file and name it .env to store your API key in a variable called API_KEY. Note: the API key is NOT a string, do not store it as such.

5. In your terminal, run npm install.

6. Run npm run build. 

7. Finally, you can open the application in your browser either through the index.html file that is automatically generated in the "dist" folder, or by running npm run start in the termianl.

## Known Bugs
The application returns NaN for all conversions that rely on the API call.
